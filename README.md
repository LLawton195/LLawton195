- 👋 Hi, I’m @LLawton195
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and Data Science. I enjoy working on projects that help make a difference based on the data they obtain and analyse, be that for personal or commercial use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL and dashboard reporting software such as Microsoft Power BI and Tableau.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in any area. I ideally want to build up experience working with varying data and be exposed to as many new projects as possible.
- 📫 How to reach me - Either by email at LLawton195@gmail.com, or through my LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewis-lawton/)!
